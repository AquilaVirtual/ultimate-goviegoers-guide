### _API Setup_

 You need to create the necessary API to enable app to work:

[Sign Up](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) for an account with 'The Movie Database.'

Once you are logged in you can go to _settings_ -> [_api_](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and create an api application.

[The Movie Database API Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

Copy the api_key and paste it in your `.env` file. It should look like this:

```
API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
